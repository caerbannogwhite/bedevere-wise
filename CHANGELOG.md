# Changelog

## v0.10-defeator-of-the-saxons

- [Feature] **Column-resize handles.** Drag the right edge of any column header (4px hit zone, faded blue line on hover, stronger during the drag) to resize that column. The body cursor stays `col-resize` even if the pointer wanders off the strip; the strip stays glued to the new column boundary across redraws.
- [Feature] **Full-row selection from the gutter.** Click the row-index gutter to select a whole row. Shift-click extends from the last anchor; ctrl/cmd-click toggles single rows. Cells / columns / rows stay mutually exclusive — selecting any one clears the other two.
- [Feature] **Multi-column sort UI.** The right-edge sort-arrow zone (rightmost ~22px of every column header) cycles asc → desc → unsorted on plain click; shift-click cycles in multi-key mode so the column slots in/out of the chain in place. Headers in a multi-key chain show a small superscript number (1, 2, 3) so the primary/secondary order is visible. The `ColumnFilterManager`'s `sorts` array gained real multi-key semantics; the existing column-stats panel asc/desc buttons keep their replace-all behaviour.
- [Feature] **Double-click a complex cell → open the inspector popover.** STRUCT / LIST / MAP / JSON / UNION cells respond to dblclick by opening the cell-value popover directly, regardless of whether the user previously dismissed the auto-open during this session — double-click is the explicit override.
- [Feature] **Recent folders shortcut in Import tab.** Browse Folder picks (Chrome / Edge with the File System Access API) are persisted to IndexedDB; the Import tab surfaces the last 5 as one-click chips. Clicking a chip re-prompts the browser permission, re-scans, and refreshes the file tree in place. Capped at 5; oldest auto-purges its IDB handle. Firefox / Safari fall back silently — the section just doesn't appear since the webkitdirectory path can't persist handles.
- [Feature] **`.export` falls back to the whole dataset** when no row / cell / column is selected, instead of warning "no selection". Matches the natural mental model: running `.export csv` with nothing highlighted exports the whole table.
- [Enhanced] **Complex cells export as full JSON** instead of the truncated `{ k: v, … N more }` preview the cell renderer uses for screen rendering. Affects Ctrl+C copy and every text/HTML/Markdown export format. Cell rendering still uses the preview (it's all the cell area can fit). BigInt → numeric string, Date → ISO, Uint8Array → array fallbacks, so JSON.stringify never throws on a clinical-data shape.
- [Enhanced] **Configurable quote-escape for CSV / TSV exports.** Settings → "Copy & export format" gains a segmented toggle: `""` (RFC 4180, default) or `\"` (JSON-style) for embedded double-quotes. Useful when the data is nested-JSON-heavy and the consumer reads `\"`-style escapes.
- [Enhanced] **Same-name file imports no longer collide.** `study.csv` from one folder and `study.csv` from another both register as DuckDB tables (`study`, `study__2`), so the second no longer overwrites the first. `.alias study__2 <new-name>` renames via DuckDB's real `ALTER TABLE … RENAME` if the suffix isn't memorable.
- [Enhanced] **Sortable hint on every column header.** Every column shows a faded up-arrow at its right-edge sort zone so the click target is visible before the user sorts, not only after. Column-width measurement reserves the slot uniformly so headers don't reflow when they pick up an active arrow.
- [Enhanced] **Selection survives sort / filter.** Previously-selected columns / rows / cells stay highlighted across `reinitialize()` (Excel-style: selection follows the screen position, not the data). Hover state still resets so a stale rect doesn't ghost the new layout.
- [Enhanced] **Cell canvas, hover, and click hit-test in lockstep across column-width changes.** Chunked column-width recompute now bumps `toDraw=Cells` between chunks so the cell canvas reflects each chunk's measurements progressively (was: stuck at chunk-1 widths until the next user interaction). Multi-sort columns reserve the +12px the position superscript actually paints. Scroll position re-syncs from the native scrollbar after `reinitialize`, so sorting a far-right column no longer bounces the rendered content back to column 0.
- [Enhanced] **Stats panel pins to the first-selected column** in click order. Multi-column ctrl-click no longer churns the panel as the user adds columns to the selection.
- [Enhanced] **Borderless column selection + hover** to match the row variant. Cell-range selection keeps its border + drag handle (the selection extent matters there).
- [Enhanced] **Postbuild WASM verifier.** `bun run build` now ends with `node scripts/verify-build.mjs`, which fails the build if the stats-duck WASM files are missing from `dist/extensions/stats-duck/`. Catches the failure mode that broke v0.9 production: someone widens `.gitignore` or deletes the junction without committing the snapshot, build silently produces an empty assets dir, deploy ships SPA-fallback HTML at the WASM URL.
- [Enhanced] **Stats-duck WASM committed to the repo.** Production no longer depends on the per-machine junction at deploy time; the snapshot lives under `public/extensions/stats-duck/` and the gitignore narrows around it. CI / clean-checkout deploys reproduce identically to a local build.
- [Bug-fix] **Ctrl+C now works for row and column selections.** The keymap action used a separate code path that only handled cells; both paths now flow through the unified `getSelection()` pipeline that copy and `.export` already share.
- [Bug-fix] **Multi-column selection on header clicks.** Shift-click and ctrl-click on a column header (left of the sort zone) now extend / toggle the selection respectively, matching the row-gutter behaviour. Was previously broken — every click replaced the selection with a single column.
- [Bug-fix] **No more full-dataset fetch on every column click.** Change-event notifications used to call the heavy export-shaped `getSelection()`, which for column-mode fetched every row. The cache's `onLoaded` events fired during the load → cell canvas churned with skeleton placeholders → "the whole spreadsheet refreshes" symptom on every column click. Notification path now uses a metadata-only summary; the export path keeps the full fetch.
- [Bug-fix] **Surface the stats-duck startup-probe reason in the user-facing error** when `VISUALIZE` is rejected. Was: "didn't load — check the browser console". Now: includes the actual cause (install rejected vs loaded-but-no-ggsql_mark_v1_*).

## v0.9-king-of-the-britons

- [Feature] **Charts via `VISUALIZE … DRAW <mark>`.** `VISUALIZE` queries are detected at dispatch time and routed past the result-table wrapper so stats_duck's parser-extension fires. The returned `(spec, layer_sqls)` row is fanned out: each layer SQL is run via DuckDB-WASM, the rows are inlined into a Vega-Lite `datasets` block, and vega-embed renders the chart in a new ChartTab alongside dataset tabs. Faceted, layered, and concat specs render correctly — the dispatcher hoists each layer's data ref to the outer spec so Vega-Lite v6's facet operator finds it. Theme-aware (re-embeds on `.theme` flip with Tokyonight-flavoured config); the vega-actions overlay is themed to match the rest of the app. Tall composite charts scroll instead of clipping and centre horizontally. vega-embed is code-split — no bundle hit for users who never plot.
- [Feature] **Chart export via `.export png|svg`.** The shell command that already handled dataset exports now also targets the active chart tab, calling the Vega view's `toImageURL("png")` / `toSVG()` and triggering a download.
- [Feature] **Non-SELECT queries.** `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, `PRAGMA`, `COPY`, `EXPORT`, `SET`, transactions: all execute directly without the `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE result_<n> AS (…)` wrap. The wrap previously corrupted DDL/DML and silently bypassed parser extensions like stats_duck's VISUALIZE.
- [Feature] **Multi-statement SQL scripts.** The editor now splits on `;` (respecting string literals, line/block comments, and dollar-quoted bodies) and dispatches each statement by kind — `SELECT/WITH` → table tab, `VISUALIZE … DRAW` → chart tab, everything else → silent side-effect. Lines starting with `.directive` queue up for the next statement and reset after; `.no-output` is the first directive — it forces the silent path regardless of the statement's natural kind.
- [Feature] **CREATE TABLE / CREATE VIEW auto-display.** The new relation opens as a dataset tab right after the side-effect runs, unless `.no-output` precedes it. Schema-qualified targets (`schema.foo`) are skipped — only bare names auto-display.
- [Feature] **`.alias <dataset> <new>`** — shell command for renaming a dataset/table via DuckDB `ALTER TABLE … RENAME` (migrated from the deprecated palette).
- [Enhanced] **Editor autocomplete enrichment.** `VISUALIZE` / `DRAW`, common SQL types (`DOUBLE`, `INTEGER`, `VARCHAR`, `TIMESTAMP`, …), and known directives (`.no-output`) surface in the dropdown. Function suggestions auto-discover from `duckdb_functions()` so any extension's contributions (stats_duck, http, iceberg, …) appear without a hand-maintained list.
- [Enhanced] **Editor syntax highlighting** restored after the oneDark removal. GGSQL keywords + known stats_duck function names colour as builtins via a `BedevereSqlDialect` that extends PostgreSQL; full token palette (keyword / string / number / comment / type / function / operator) binds to tokyonight CSS variables so light/dark flips repaint live.
- [Enhanced] **Editor + shell keyboard consistency.** Enter accepts the highlighted autocomplete suggestion in both surfaces (Tab still accepts in the shell as a bash-style alternate). Editor Tab now inserts a tab character instead of leaking focus to the surrounding chrome, Ctrl+Enter executes the query exactly once (was double-firing through two keymap layers), and global shortcuts like Ctrl+/ defer to the editor when CodeMirror has already consumed the chord — toggling a line comment no longer also pops the help panel. Shell suggestion dropdown shows up to 50 matches (was 8) with active-row scrollIntoView on arrow-key navigation.
- [Enhanced] **Help panel refresh for 0.9.** About tab leads with a "What's new" highlights list and a vertical Dependencies list with per-library blurbs. How-to tutorial: the parse-the-dataset example wraps in `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE penguins_clean AS …`, the "create a view" tip is gone (CommandPalette is gone), and a new "Plot it" section shows a `VISUALIZE … DRAW point` example end-to-end.
- [Enhanced] **Status bar tracks the active tab kind.** When a chart tab is focused, the status bar shows the chart name and clears the stale spreadsheet selection info; switching back to a dataset tab restores cell context.
- [Enhanced] **Control-panel duck-toggle.** When the control panel is minimized, the toggle button shows the duck icon instead of `+`.
- [Enhanced] Result tables now use friendly `result_1`, `result_2`, … names instead of `query_result_<huge-timestamp>`. Type-able in JOINs by hand; renameable via `.alias result_1 mydata` (which calls DuckDB's real ALTER TABLE so existing references keep working).
- [Bug-fix] Theme flip now repaints the spreadsheet immediately. The module-level theme-color cache was racy with the body-class MutationObserver — the listener could fire before the cache invalidator, baking stale colors into each visualizer's options. Now the listener invalidates the cache itself before recomputing.
- [Bug-fix] **DECIMAL columns plot at their real value.** Chart datasets now scale `DECIMAL(p,s)` columns when materializing rows from Arrow — both plain numbers/bigints and Decimal128 word buffers (Uint32Array) — so `errorbar`, `point`, etc. read the actual value instead of the raw integer ×10^s.
- [Removed] **CommandPalette (Ctrl+Shift+P).** Deprecated in 0.8; gone in 0.9. Every palette-only command was either covered by an existing shell command or migrated (`.alias`).
- [Removed] **View storage.** `.view save|drop`, `ViewManager`, and the `bedevere_views` localStorage key are gone. Saved views were unrecoverable across page reloads (source tables vanish), producing `worker_dispatcher` cascades on every refresh. Saved queries (`.query save`) cover the persist-my-SQL workflow; raw `CREATE VIEW` SQL works in-session now that non-SELECT queries are allowed.
- [Removed] **GitHub Pages deploy workflow.** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` removed. Cloudflare Workers Builds (custom domain `bedeverewise.app`) is now the only deploy target.

## v0.8-from-the-castle-of-camelot

- [Feature] Dot-command shell hosted in the always-visible bar above the spreadsheet. Lines starting with `.` dispatch through a unified CommandRegistry; anything else runs as DuckDB SQL. History walks Up/Down and persists across sessions (capped at 200 lines).
- [Feature] `CommandRegistry` — the single source of truth for every verb. Palette, keymap, and shell all resolve through it.
- [Feature] Shell commands: `.help [name]`, `.how-to`, `.shortcuts`, `.feedback`, `.about`, `.tables`, `.columns [name]` (defaults to active tab), `.import [--folder]`, `.open <name>` (matches any Datasets-tree leaf, imports if needed), `.close [name | --all]`, `.theme light|dark|auto`, `.tab next|prev|N`, `.settings [key=value]` (opens Settings tab when no args), `.view save|drop <name>`, `.query save <name>`, `.export <csv|tsv|html|markdown>` (copies to clipboard AND downloads `<dataset>.<ext>`), `.clear`, plus shell shortcuts for global keymap actions (`.panel`, `.sql`, `.fullscreen`, `.palette`, `.focus`).
- [Feature] CommandBar autocomplete: command names complete on dot-prefix; positional arguments complete from each parameter's `options()` thunk (e.g. `.open ` lists Datasets-tree leaves, `.theme ` offers `light/dark/auto`). Tab completes, Up/Down navigate, Esc dismisses.
- [Feature] Help panel gains a Commands tab — registry-driven listing grouped by category. `.help` opens it instead of dumping a multi-screen manual into the status-bar tooltip.
- [Feature] Keybindings: `Ctrl+/` toggles the help panel; `` Ctrl+` `` focuses the shell input.
- [Feature] Tokyonight re-skin: Vim-flavoured palette (Day light / Storm dark) exposed via CSS custom properties; theme switching is a body-class flip with no SCSS recompile.
- [Feature] Spreadsheet renderer Phase A: HiDPI-sharp glyphs and a single-pass grid pipeline.
- [Feature] In-app feedback form (HelpPanel → Feedback) backed by a Cloudflare Worker + D1 store; `mailto:contact@bedeverewise.app` fallback for deployments without the worker.
- [Feature] Deploy story: Cloudflare Workers Builds (recommended) + GitHub Pages, custom domain `bedeverewise.app`, DuckDB-WASM loaded from jsDelivr to keep the bundle slim.
- [Enhanced] Global-scope keymap actions (`app.togglePanel`, `app.toggleSqlEditor`, `tabs.next`, `tabs.prev`, etc.) resolve via `commandRegistry.run(action)` instead of hand-maintained switch statements in three callers.
- [Enhanced] Spreadsheet-scope keymap actions (`spreadsheet.moveUp`, `spreadsheet.copy`, etc.) also unify through the registry, routing to the active tab's `SpreadsheetVisualizer`.
- [Enhanced] CommandBar is always visible — reachable before the first dataset is imported so `.import` / `.help` work from a cold start. SqlEditor input also routes through the dot-command dispatcher (a `.command` typed there + Ctrl+Enter behaves the same as in the CommandBar).
- [Enhanced] `.sql` toggle now also focuses the SQL editor; `.close --all` closes every open dataset.
- [Enhanced] Status-bar version chip uses dedicated `--version-bg` / `--version-fg` tokens (the light-theme yellow was muddy as a fill); the margin between version and adjacent message chips was dropped so success/error chips sit flush.
- [Enhanced] Suggestions dropdown anchored to a wrapper around the input (`left: 0` / `right: 0`) instead of magic pixel offsets — aligns regardless of prompt or font.
- [Bug-fix] `.columns` uses `information_schema.columns` instead of `DESCRIBE` (DuckDB's `DESCRIBE` can't appear inside a `CREATE TABLE … AS (…)` wrapper).
- [Deprecated] CommandPalette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) is flagged for removal in 0.9. It keeps working in 0.8, backed by the new registry.
- [Removed] Duplicate palette entries `view.toggleLeftPanel` and `sql.toggleEditor` (superseded by `app.togglePanel` / `app.toggleSqlEditor`).

## v0.7-son-of-uther-pendragon

- [Feature] Inspectable STRUCT / LIST / MAP / JSON / UNION cells with a key/value popover that auto-opens as the selection lands on a complex cell (respects Esc dismissal)
- [Feature] Query execution time shown as a status-bar chip (⏱ for success / ✖ for failures) with smart unit switching (ms / s / m s)
- [Feature] Loading feedback for file and folder imports — per-file progress messages and an aggregated success / partial / failure summary at the end of a batch
- [Feature] Settings tab exposes date, datetime, number, and display preferences (decimal places, thousands separator, minimum column width, max chars per cell); preferences persist across reloads
- [Feature] Configurable keymap with a rebind UI and a Reset keymap action
- [Feature] Tab-switch keyboard shortcuts and copy-format preferences (delimiter, include-header)
- [Feature] Help panel SQL tutorial keyed on the Penguins sample dataset
- [Enhanced] Cells that overflow their column now render an ellipsis instead of horizontally squeezed glyphs
- [Enhanced] Columns keep their content-derived width instead of stretching to fill the viewport
- [Enhanced] Type-aware Arrow unwrap; DECIMAL, nested-struct, and map payloads render correctly
- [Enhanced] Arrow keys no longer move cell selection while typing in an input
- [Bug-fix] Date / datetime format presets now honour the literal pattern (previously all presets produced identical output because Intl.DateTimeFormat ignored property order)
- [Bug-fix] Numeric format settings actually apply (previously the options bag was stringified to "[object Object]" and discarded)
- [Bug-fix] Cell cache TTL was 1 minute despite a "5 minutes" comment; corrected to 5 minutes
- [Renamed] MultiDatasetVisualizer → TabManager
- [Chore] Consolidated `escapeHtml` into `src/utils/html.ts`; removed unused event-system types, container-size constants, and a broken export-dataset stub
